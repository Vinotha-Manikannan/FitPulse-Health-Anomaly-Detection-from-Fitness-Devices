---

## Project Overview

FitPulse is a health analytics application designed to analyze fitness device data and detect abnormal health patterns.  
The system processes physiological and activity-based data such as heart rate, sleep duration, daily steps, and stress levels to generate meaningful insights and predictions.

The project integrates data preprocessing, feature extraction, machine learning models, and an interactive dashboard to provide end-to-end health monitoring and anomaly detection.

## Objectives

- Analyze fitness device data for health monitoring  
- Detect abnormal health behavior using machine learning  
- Extract meaningful features from time-series data  
- Forecast future health trends  
- Present insights through an interactive dashboard  

---

## Key Features

- Interactive health analytics dashboard  
- Heart rate, sleep, and activity analysis  
- Time-series forecasting using Prophet  
- Feature extraction using TSFresh  
- Clustering and anomaly detection using DBSCAN  
- Health check page based on dataset patterns  
- Modular and scalable project architecture
